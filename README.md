# Transfer Funtion Modelling

Electricity Consumption of a City is to be forecasted and it has a time Series. But it is intervened by Temperature that acts as an Input. So, a transfer function model was built to forecast the Electricity Consumption

## Forecasting Temperature 

Temperature itself is a time series model, and it was modelled using many other techniques including Holt-Winters Model, Spectral Analysis and Seasonal ARIMA. And Finally it was seen that Seasonal ARIMA predicted Temperature better

## Forecasting Electricity 

Temperature acted as an Input to Electricity (Intervention). So, a transfer function model was developed to predict the Electricity of the city. 

## Tools Used

R, JMP, Minitab, Excel
